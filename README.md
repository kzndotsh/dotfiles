## About

Welcome to my home, a curated collection of my personal dotfiles, tweaks, themes, and configurations that I use to make my Arch Linux experience truly unique and stylish while also productive.


## Management

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles. GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.
