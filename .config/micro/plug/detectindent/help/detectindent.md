# Detectindent

Whenever a file is opened, the detectindent plugin tries to automatically
detect its indentation style (spaces or tabs) and set the `tabstospaces`
option accordingly. If spaces indentation is detected, it also tries to
detect the indentation width and set the `tabsize` option accordingly.

To disable it, just turn off the plugin:

```
set detectindent off
```
