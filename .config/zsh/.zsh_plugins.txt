# .zsh_plugins.txt - antidote plugins file
#

### Overview
#
# The `.zsh_plugins.txt` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
# `.zsh_plugins.txt` is used by antidote to generate a static `.zsh_plugins.zsh` file,
# which can then be sourced in your `.zshrc`. You can use this file as a starting point
# for your own config. Strip out instructional comments (ie: lines beginning with a '#')
# and any plugins you don't need, then add what you like and make it yours!
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.
#
###


### Regular Plugins
#
# Plugins are the simplest kind of bundles. You can point to a full git URL, or if you
# assume GitHub.com, then you can use the user/repo shorthand.

### Local Plugins
#
# Plugins don't have to come from GitHub. You can also use local files or directories to
# host your own custom plugins.
#
###
# $ZDOTDIR/.aliases
#$ZDOTDIR/custom/plugins/example

### Local Plugins with Variables
#
# If you want to use variables in this file, you will need to use the envsubst utility.
# It may come installed on your system, or be available in your OS package manager. Or,
# you can use the Python one-liner wrapper function included in this sample project.
# To replace environment variables, you need to change your `antidote bundle` call to
# this.
#
#   zsh_plugins=${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zsh_plugins.zsh
#   envsubst <${zsh_plugins:r}.txt | antidote bundle >|$zsh_plugins

### Prompts
#
# You can make certain themes available to the built-in Zsh prompt command using the
# `kind:fpath` annotation. A theme is not active for the prompt until this command is
# run:
#
#   autoload -Uz promptinit && promptinit
#   prompt ${prompt_name:-pure}
#
# There are two ways to load prompts.
# - Add multiple prompt plugins to your `$fpath` with `kind:fpath` and then later in
#   your .zshrc run the Zsh built-in `prompt` to select the theme.
# - Or, just load one prompt like a regular plugin.
#
###

# Use kind:fpath for prompts you want available to promptinit.
# romkatv/powerlevel10k kind:fpath

# Or, just load a prompt plugin the normal way.
# sindresorhus/pure


### Utilities
#
# Utilities aren't traditional Zsh plugins - they aren't sourced Zsh scripts. Instead
# they provide commands that can be executed from your terminal session. One good
# example is zsh-bench, which is a utility that benchmarks your Zsh config. Utility
# bundles can often be made available simply with the `kind:path` annotation.
#
###
# romkatv/zsh-bench kind:path


### Frameworks
#
# Frameworks are a collection of Zsh features, settings, and plugins meant to ease
# Zsh configuration. Unfortunately, all that power can come with serious drawbacks.
# Frameworks can often set more settings or aliases than you need, cluttering your Zsh
# config and slowing things down. Use with caution!
#
# Frameworks are handled in antidote using the `path:location/of/plugin` annotation.
#
###

### Framework: Oh-My-Zsh
#
# Oh-My-Zsh is a very popular Zsh framework. You might choose to use plugins from OMZ
# in your own config. Depending on which plugins you use, you may also need to include
# OMZ's entire "lib" directory. If you do this, be careful - "lib" configures a lot of
# very broad settings. If you are familiar with what you are doing, you may choose to
# only include parts of "lib".
#
#   # use all of lib
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib
#   # -OR-, only use only the specific files we care about
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/clipboard.zsh
#

ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/extract
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/magic-enter
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/fancy-ctrl-z


### Framework: Prezto
#
# Prezto is another popular Zsh framework. You might choose to use parts of it in your
# config alongside/instead of OMZ. Prezto has some key differences from OMZ. For
# starters, it doesn't have a lib directory and it calls its plugins 'modules'. Its
# modules also often have functions directories that need autoloaded. And, because it's
# meant to be used as an integrated framework, Prezto modules don't operate well as
# cherry-picking independent plugins, so using Prezto with antidote is not recommended
# for anyone but the most advanced Zsh users.
#
###

# Prezto can be difficult to assemble because it's so interdependent.
# Use at your own risk.

### Framework: zsh-utils
#
# zsh-utils is a micro-framework that is also well suited to pair with antidote. It
# provides much of the same core functionality from other bigger frameworks without the
# bloat or performance hit. Using zsh-utils, you may find you don't need much else.
# If you want a really thin framework, this is great.

### Deferred Plugins
#
# Antidote allows you to defer loading plugins. This is similar to concepts like "turbo
# mode" in other plugin managers. Antidote handles deferring plugins by leveraging
# romkatv/zsh-defer, which "defers execution of a zsh command until zsh has nothing else
# to do and is waiting for user input". In general, you should not defer plugins unless
# you know for sure they properly support deferred loading, and there are no adverse
# side-effects (see: https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-defer#Caveats). However, for
# certain plugins, this can greatly increase your zsh startup speed.

### Completions
#
# You may want to add some additional completions to Zsh. Completions look in your fpath
# for completion functions, which are functions named with a leading underscore
# (eg: _git). You need to add all supplemental completions to your fpath prior to
# running `compinit` to use completions functionality properly. You will want to find
# a completion plugin that runs `compinit` for you, or you can run it yourself in
# your .zshrc after antidote loads like this:
#
#   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
#
###

# zsh-users/zsh-completions is a popular plugin for adding supplemental completions.
# We combine the `path:` and `kind:fpath` annotations here:
zsh-users/zsh-completions path:src kind:fpath

# Compinit plugins should be near the end of .zsh_plugins.txt so that $fpath has been
# fully populated. Use zsh-utils for its completion plugin.

### Final Plugins
#
# Remember plugin order matters! Put plugins that need run last at the bottom of your
# .zsh_plugins.txt file.
#

# These popular core plugins should be loaded at the end
